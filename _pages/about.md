Hi there, glad you could drop in! ðŸ‘‹

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>, working under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://hguo.github.io">Hanqi Guo</a>. 

My research focuses on unraveling complex topological structures within diverse data representations, with a particular interest in the intersections of topology, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.

Before coming to Ohio State, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.njtech.edu.cn/">Nanjing Tech University</a> and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.nuist.edu.cn/mainm.psp">Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy jogging, listening to Neo-Chinese style music, a little bit of calligraphy and a little bit of violin.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University, working under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://hguo.github.io">Hanqi Guo</a>. My research focuses on unraveling complex topological structures within diverse data representations, with a particular interest in the intersections of topology, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence.

Before coming to Ohio State, I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Nanjing Tech University and my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
